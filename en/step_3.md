## Connecting a Sparkle

Crumble Sparkles are RGB LEDs made specially to be used with the Crumble controller.

The RGB stands for red, green and blue. Using the Crumble software, we can set different levels red, green and blue to display any of nearly 17 million colours!

Before we can do that, we need to connect a Sparkle to our Crumble.

The Sparkle will connect to the positive (+), negative (-) and 'D' terminals on the Crumble controller.

Let's start with the positive.

Use a crocodile clip to connect from the positive output (+) on the right side of the Crumble to the positive input (+) on the left side of the Sparkle.
