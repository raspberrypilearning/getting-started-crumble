## Introduction

A Crumble is a very low-cost electronics controller that connects to a computer using a USB cable. You can attach components like LEDs, buttons, and motors to the Crumble using crocodile leads, and you can program your Crumble using free software.

### What you will make

In this beginner Crumble project, you will learn how to set up a Crumble controller, connect common physical computing components such as motors and LEDs to it, and write simple code to make each component work.

### Hardware

Necessary:
+ A computer with:
    1. The Crumble software installed
    1. A USB port
+ A Crumble starter kit, or the components bought separately

Widely available, inexpensive physical computing components:
+ A position servo motor with jumper cables, or a Crumbliser
+ A DC motor (3V to 6V)
+ An LED

**If you don't have some of these components, skip the tasks for which you are missing items. You can do all the other tasks anyway.**

### Software

+ [Crumble software](https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/crumble-software/){:target="_blank"} â€” free and available for PC, Mac, Chromebook, and Linux devices
