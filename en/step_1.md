## Introduction

A crumble controller is a very low-cost electronics controller that connects to a computer using a USB cable. Components like LEDs, switches, motors and servos can be connected using crocodile leads and can be programmed using Crumbleâ€™s free software.

### What you will make

In this first Crumble project you will learn to setup a Crumble controller, connect a range of common physical computing components such as motors and LEDs, and write simple Crumble codes to make each of them work.

### Hardware

+ A PC or Mac with Crumble software installed and a USB port
+ Or a Chromebook with Crumble BETA software and a USB port
+ A Crumble starter kit - or the components bought separately
+ A position servo with jumper cables or a Crumbliser
+ A DC motor (3v to 6v)
+ An LED

Don't worry, if you don't have some of these components. As long as you have a computer and a Crumble you can just skip the sections where you are missing items. All the other sections will still work fine. All the components are widely available and inexpensive.

### Software

+ [Crumble](https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/crumble-software/){:target="_blank"} software. We will look at how to install the software in the ***** 'Setting up the Crumble controller' ***** section.
