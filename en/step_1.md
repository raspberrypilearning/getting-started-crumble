## Introduction

A crumble controller is a low-cost electronics controller that connects to a computer using a USB cable. Components like LEDs, switches, motors and servos can be connected using crocodile leads and can be programmed using Crumbleâ€™s free software.

In this project you will learn to connect a crumble controller and crumble sparkle LEDs, and write your first simple crumble code.
