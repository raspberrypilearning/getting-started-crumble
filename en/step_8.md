## Challenge: Servo random position generator

Can you write code to make your servo keep moving to random positions?

Remember that the servo will need a little time to get to each position before going to a new random position.

Try and write code so that when the `program starts`{:class="crumblebasic"}, `your servo`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"} will `always`{:class="crumblecontrol"} go to a `random`{:class="crumblemaths"} `position`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"}, `wait half a second`{:class="crumblecontrol"} and then go to another `random`{:class="crumblemaths"} `position`{:class="crumbleinputoutput"} and so on.

You will need to use the blocks below to create the random position code.

Can you rearrange them to make the code work?
